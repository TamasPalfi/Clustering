What maybe doesn't work: The handling of the command line prompts meaning the correct args[] values to extract the files and #.
						 My javac command doesn't seem to work on cmd prompt, so couldn't test it.  It should be correct values 
						 but if not then its likely just incremented by one.  See beginning of main method.
					
What works: Everything else works! The problem properly reads the file and outputs in correct manner.
